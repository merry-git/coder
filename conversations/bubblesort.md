Write me a function to do bubble sort on an array in python. Generate sample data and once the function works, stop

Professor (to Student):


Here's a sample Python function to perform bubble sort on an array:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
To test the function with sample data, you can use the following code:
```python
arr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]
print(bubble_sort(arr))
```
This will output the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`.

The error you are seeing is because the `bubble_sort` function is not defined in your code. You need to define the function before you can use it.

Here's an updated version of your code with the `bubble_sort` function defined:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

arr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]
print(bubble_sort(arr))
```
This code should now output the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]`.
