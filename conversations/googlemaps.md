Please note that this code requires the Google Maps Places API key and location data to work. The API key should be obtained from the Google Cloud Console and stored securely. Additionally, the location data needs to be provided as an argument to the script. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please let me know.

import requests

# Define the URL for the Google Maps Places API
url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place" + '?location=' + location + '&radius=1000' + '&type=' + type + '&key=' + api_key

# Send a GET request to the URL and store the response in a variable
response = requests.get(url)

# Convert the response data to JSON format and store it in a variable
data = response.json()

# Extract the results from the API response and store them in a list called "places"
places = data['results']

# Print the number of places returned by the API
print("Number of places: " + str(len(places)))

# Iterate through each place in the list and print its details
for place in places:
    # Extract the required information from each place object
    name = place['name']
    address = place['formatted_address']
    rating = str(place['rating'])
    reviews = str(place['review_count'])
    price_level = str(place['price_level'])
    types = str(place['types'])

    
    # Print the details of each place
    print("Place name: " + name)
    print("Address: " + address)
    print("Rating: " + rating)
    print("Reviews: " + reviews)
    print("Price level: " + price_level)
    print("Types: " + types)
    print("\n")
